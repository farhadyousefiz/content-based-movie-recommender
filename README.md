Content Based Movie Recommendations System using machine Learning

Wondered how Google comes up with movies that are similar to the ones you like? After reading this post you will be able to build one such recommendation system for yourself.

This type of recommendation systems(Content Based), takes in a movie that a user currently likes as input. Then it analyzes the contents (storyline, genre, cast, director etc.) of the movie to find out other movies which have similar content. Then it ranks similar movies according to their similarity scores and recommends the most relevant movies to the user.
